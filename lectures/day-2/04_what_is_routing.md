## Describe Routing

- Routing is the process an app uses to mimic the feel of traditional navigation
- The process:
    1. Define a set of URLs for the app to listen for
    1. When a user visits those particular URLs, the app will load a component into a specific part of the page

## Demo Routing

Demo the site in [/router](/router).  Show the following:

1. Clicks on the various links
    - Note the nested links for `/about`
    - Note the url params for `/resume`
1. Demonstrate sharing/bookmarking a URL
    1. Copy a url like http://localhost:4200/links
    1. Close the browser
    1. Reopen the browser
    1. Paste the link into the URL bar
    1. Hit Enter
    1. Note that it takes you directly to the "page" whose URL you copied
