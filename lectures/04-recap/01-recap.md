## What We've Learned So Far

Over the past few days, we've taken a deep dive into the world of Angular. We've touched on both the core Angular APIs and the satellite libraries that make using Angular much easier.

### Day One: Introduction to Angular

We started our first day by dipping our toes into Angular, and by the end of it we were able to write our own applications from scratch. The Angular CLI played a big role in our work, as we learned how to use it to generate our scaffolding and serve our applications. Components were also a big focus of our work. We learned what a components is, why they're useful, and how to write them in an Angular context. When our applications started becoming more complicated, we used services to abstract out our business logic and keep our code DRY. Finally, we rounded out the day by learning about modules and how they can keep our code organized.

### Day Two: Navigation and AJAX

On day two, we pushed the boundaries of what our simple applications could do. We learned about what single-page applications are and how they differ from the traditional web application model. Next, we learned how to use the Angular router to break our SPAs out into distinct pages and how to use `pushState()` to get these pages to play nicely with our browsers.

Afterward, we pushed the envelope even further by incorporating AJAX into our applications. We used Angular's HTTP service and our knowledge of URL parameters to interact with an API and make our app more dynamic.

### Day Three: Asynchronicity, Testing, and Everything In Between

With the fundamentals down pat, we started filling in the cracks on day three. We covered Promises and Observables, exploring the strengths and weaknesses of using both to wrangle asynchronous behavior. Then we took a hard pivot into the world of testing and explored the default testing set up that Angular provides.

## Exercise: It's All Coming Back to You Now

Let's make sure that everything we've covered so far has sunk in. Answer the following questions to the best of your ability.

1) What is a component and why do we use them?
2) What is an SPA? What are the advantages of using SPAs over more tradition web application models?
3) What are the differences between Observables and Promises?
